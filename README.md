Axelrod
=======

This is an attempted recreation of the Prisoners' Dilemma competition held by Robert Axelrod, and described by Axelrod & Hamilton (1981).  On each turn, each participant may either cooperate or defect. Thebenefits or punishments depend upon what the other participant chooses.  Participants will have access only to their own past moves, as well as those of the other.  Each participant will carry out a defined strategy, which they may use their knowledge, as well as employ randomness into their decisions.
